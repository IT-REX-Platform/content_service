# Content Service

The Content Service serves as a critical component within our system, providing essential information about course
content:

1. **Content Information:** This service offers detailed insights into the content that is part of a course. Users can
   access information about which chapters the content belongs to, the unlock dates for specific content, and any
   prerequisites that need to be learned before unlocking certain content.

2. **Dependency Annotations:** Lecturers can use the Content Service to annotate non-trivial dependencies between
   different pieces of content, enhancing the learning experience.

## Purpose

The Content Service plays a pivotal role in our system by:

- **Supporting Learning:** It ensures that students have access to information about course content, helping them
  understand what needs to be learned and in what order.

- **Enhancing Learning Paths:** By providing unlock dates and prerequisites, the service can suggest foundational
  content for students who may need additional preparation for quizzes or games.

- **Facilitating Lecturer Engagement:** Lecturers can annotate content dependencies.
