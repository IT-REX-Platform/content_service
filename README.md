# Content Service

The Content Service serves as a critical component within our system, providing essential information about course
content:

1. **Content Information:** This service offers detailed insights into the content that is part of a course. Users can
   access information about which chapters the content belongs to, the unlock dates for specific content, and any
   prerequisites that need to be learned before unlocking certain content.

2. **Dependency Annotations:** Lecturers can use the Content Service to annotate non-trivial dependencies between
   different pieces of content, enhancing the learning experience.
